This app attempts to help people understand how their community changed as a result of Covid-19. The thesis is that using data from the [American Community Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey) (ACS) can help with that. All data comes from the ACS 1-year estimates. 

Note that counties are only included in this dataset if they have a population of at least 65,000. And data was not published for 2020 due to Covid-19.

I have written several blog posts that go into more detail about this project. Two notable ones are:
 * [Visualizing the Impact of Covid-19 on US Counties](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/04/visualizing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-us-counties/) describes the current version of the app.
 * [Building a Census Explorer in Python: Part 1](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/02/04/building-a-census-explorer-in-python-part-1/) discusses the technology choices made at the start of the project.

This project is under active development. If you'd like to be notified of new versions then please subscribe to my [blog](https://arilamstein.com/).
