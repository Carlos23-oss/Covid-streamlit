This app attempts to help people understand how their communities changed as a result of Covid-19. The thesis is that using selected variables from the US Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey) 1-year estimates, at the county level, can help with that. 

I have written several blog posts that go into more detail about this project. The most recent, [Visualizing the Impact of Covid-19 on US Counties](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/04/visualizing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-us-counties/), goes into more detail about the current version of the app.

The app originally began as a side project to help me achieve a career goal of "learning Python as well as I know R". I have extensive experience experience making data apps in R using the "Shiny" package, and have frequently used public data for my open source projects (especially US Census data). My first post about the project, [Building a Census Explorer in Python: Part 1](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/02/04/building-a-census-explorer-in-python-part-1/) discusses the technology choices used in this project.

This app is under active development. If you'd like to be notified of new versions, I recommend subscribing to my blog, which you can do [here](https://arilamstein.com/).
