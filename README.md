This [app](https://census-explorer.streamlit.app/) uses data from the American Community Survey to help people understand how America has changed since Covid-19. 

You can learn more about this project here:
 * [A Python App to Explore How Covid Changed America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdmR5YxGS4g&t=25s): a talk I gave about this project at the San Francisco Python Meetup.
 * [Creating Time Series Data from the American Community Survey (ACS)](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/28/creating-time-series-data-from-the-american-community-survey-acs/): a blog post about how the dataset is generated.
 * [Visualizing the Impact of Covid-19 on US Counties](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/04/visualizing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-us-counties/): a blog post about the choice to use counties as the geographic unit for this project.
 * [Building a Census Explorer in Python: Part 1](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/02/04/building-a-census-explorer-in-python-part-1/): a blog post about the technology choices made at the start of the project.

My hope is that this project will inspire others to use Python to explore Census data. If you'd like to use this repo as a starting off point for your own project, see `DEVELOPER.md`.
