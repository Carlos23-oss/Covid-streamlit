This [app](https://census-explorer.streamlit.app/) uses data from the American Community Survey to help people understand how America has changed since Covid-19. 

In addition to informing the public, I hope that this project will inspire others to use Python to explore Census data. If you'd like to use this repo as a starting off point for your own project, see [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md).

In June 2024 I spoke about this project at the San Francisco Python Meetup. You can watch a recording of that talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdmR5YxGS4g&t=25s).

In addition to the talk, I've written several blog posts about this project:
 * [New Release: Covid Demographics Explorer v2](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2025/06/02/new-release-covid-demographics-explorer-v2/) discusses the addition of the Swarm plot as well as improvements to the codebase.
 * [Creating Time Series Data from the American Community Survey (ACS)](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/28/creating-time-series-data-from-the-american-community-survey-acs/) explains how the dataset is generated.
 * [Visualizing the Impact of Covid-19 on US Counties](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/04/visualizing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-us-counties/) discusses the choice to use counties as the geographic unit for this project.
 * [Building a Census Explorer in Python: Part 1](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/02/04/building-a-census-explorer-in-python-part-1/) explains the technology choices made at the start of the project.
