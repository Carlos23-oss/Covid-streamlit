All data comes from the [American Community Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey) 1-year estimates. Counties are only included in this dataset if they have a population of at least 65,000. Data was not published for 2020 due to Covid-19.

I have written several blog posts that go into more detail about this project. Two notable ones are:
 * [Creating Time Series Data from the American Community Survey (ACS)](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/28/creating-time-series-data-from-the-american-community-survey-acs/)
 * [Visualizing the Impact of Covid-19 on US Counties](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/05/04/visualizing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-us-counties/) describes the current version of the app.
 * [Building a Census Explorer in Python: Part 1](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/02/04/building-a-census-explorer-in-python-part-1/) discusses the technology choices made at the start of the project.

This project is under active development. If you'd like to be notified of new versions then please subscribe to my [blog](https://arilamstein.com/).
